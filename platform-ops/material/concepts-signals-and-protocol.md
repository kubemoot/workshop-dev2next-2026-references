Agents in a crew never call each other directly. They publish to a message bus
(NATS JetStream), and every contribution carries a **signal** that says how it relates
to the emerging answer. The signals plus a phase model are the whole protocol - there
is no central controller issuing commands.

## Consensus signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `agree` | This contribution supports the emerging answer. |
| `concern` | A reservation that should be weighed before the crew settles. |
| `stand_aside` | No relevant contribution; abstain without blocking. |
| `block` | A strong objection that should stop the answer as it stands. |
| `failure` | The agent tried and could not complete - surfaced as a first-class signal, not hidden behind silence. |

Treating **failure as signal** is deliberate. An agent that fails a tool call or
cannot reach a source says so, so the coordinator can route around it, rather than
standing aside silently and letting the crew mistake "no answer" for "no objection."

Additional protocol signals facilitate the discussion itself - `triaging`,
`evaluating`, `advisory`, `proposal`, `consent`. Which signals a crew exercises, and
how strongly each counts, depends on its consensus archetype (see
[The Moot](../consensus-model/)).

## Discussion phases

A discussion advances by **state**, not by a fixed timer. The coordinator runs a
per-thread state machine with the following phases:

`SUBMITTED` → `ADVISORY` → `EVALUATING` → `REVIEW` → `SYNTHESIZING` → `CLOSED`

A `PAUSED` state can interrupt any phase except `SYNTHESIZING` and `CLOSED`; the
machine resumes to the same phase when unpaused. A dashboard Stop forces an
immediate transition to `SYNTHESIZING` on whatever signals exist. A human reply on a
closed thread reopens it to `EVALUATING`.

In plain terms, the flow is:

1. **ADVISORY** - the coordinator generates the framing advisory and selects the
   Tooler subcommittee; Toolers acknowledge with `triaging`.
2. **EVALUATING** - selected Toolers call their domain MCP tools and publish findings,
   each carrying a signal.
3. **REVIEW** - Analysts (if the crew has them) reason over the Toolers' gathered data
   and contribute interpretive findings before synthesis. The coordinator waits for
   every selected Analyst to report; there is no fast path in this phase.
4. **SYNTHESIZING** - the coordinator composes the answer from all contributions.
5. **CLOSED** - the answer has been delivered and the thread is clean.

Timeouts exist only as safety nets. The normal path is driven by signal state: who
has reported, what they signalled, and whether the discussion has quieted. GPU
inference and model loading have unpredictable latency, so the protocol waits on
state transitions, not wall-clock deadlines.

The full state machine (all states, both automatic and event-driven transitions, and
the key design principles) is documented in
[The Moot - Discussion phase lifecycle](../consensus-model/#discussion-phase-lifecycle).

## Why a protocol instead of direct calls

Routing every contribution through the bus with an explicit signal makes disagreement
and abstention **observable**. The coordinator settles on what the crew actually
reported - agreements net of concerns and blocks - instead of taking the first or
loudest answer. It also means an agent crashing or timing out degrades gracefully:
its absence (or its `failure` signal) is visible to the coordinator rather than
silently corrupting the result.
