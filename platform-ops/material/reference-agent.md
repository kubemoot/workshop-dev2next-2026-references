## Overview

The Agent CRD declares an LLM-powered agent as a thin, capability-only resource and deploys it as a Kubernetes-native service. The Agent spec carries no model name, no provider, and no GPU hint. Agents declare *what they can do*; the scheduler matches them to a `(model, provider, endpoint)` via `CrewSchedulingPolicy` rules over labeled `Model` CRs.

Agents orchestrate:
- **Models**: LLM inference resolved by the scheduler from `spec.capabilities` + `CrewSchedulingPolicy` (see [scheduler.md](../architecture/scheduler.md))
- **Knowledge**: RAG retrieval via `spec.ragSources`
- **Tools**: MCP tool execution via the MCPGateway, filtered by `spec.enabledTools` / `spec.disabledTools`
- **Collaboration**: Multi-agent discussions via NATS JetStream, configured by `spec.discussRole` / `spec.discussChannels` / `spec.discussKeywords`
- **Prompts**: System prompts composed from `PromptModule` CRs referenced by `spec.promptRefs`

## Supported Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `chat` | Conversational agent with HTTP API |
| `task` | Task-oriented agent (planned) |
| `workflow` | Multi-step workflow orchestration (planned) |

---

## Spec Fields

### `spec.type`
Agent type. Default: `chat`. Only `chat` is implemented today.

### `spec.description`
Human-readable description of the agent's purpose. Shown in the dashboard. Keep it factual and short - one sentence.

### `spec.capabilities[]`
Required. Open-string label set declaring what this agent can do. Matched by `CrewSchedulingPolicy.spec.rules[].require.matchLabels` (as `capability/<name>: "true"`) against the labels on candidate `Model` CRs.

Common values: `tool-calling`, `reasoning`, `kubernetes`, `proxmox`, `observability`, `harbor`, `git`, `helm`, `web-search`.

### `spec.discussRole`
Role this agent plays in a discussion thread.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `generic` (default) | General contributor. Participates in discussions but does not hold the Tooler raw-output contract. Use when an agent is not a domain Tooler, Analyst, coordinator, or researcher. |
| `tooler` | **Tooler** role: subscribes to channels, calls MCP tools in the EVALUATING phase, participates with signals (`agree`, `concern`, `stand_aside`, `failure`, `block`). Thinking is OFF for deterministic tool selection. |
| `analyst` | **Analyst** role: participates in the REVIEW phase with thinking ON. Carries RAG sources and reasons over the data Toolers gathered. No live MCP tools. |
| `coordinator` | Receives user queries, generates advisory, runs triage, synthesizes responses. `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_COORDINATOR=true`, `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_TOOLER=false` |
| `researcher` | Contributes to synthesis but excluded from settle triggers, fast path, and gap detection. Used for non-settle-gating agents such as internet search that augment the discussion without owning a definitive answer. |

### `spec.discussChannels[]`
NATS discussion channels the agent subscribes to. The coordinator should list every channel the crew uses (e.g., `[kubernetes, observability, proxmox, general]`); a Tooler or Analyst lists only its domain (e.g., `[kubernetes]`). Channels are metadata, not routing gates - subcommittee selection is the coordinator's job (via the resume model), not channel routing.

### `spec.discussKeywords[]`
Optional. Domain keywords that become part of this agent's **resume** (alongside its description, tools, and role). The coordinator's resume model embeds the resume and matches it semantically against each question to pick the subcommittee, so keywords inform selection without being a literal gate. Set to `["*"]` to opt into every thread (used by researcher agents like internet-search).

### `spec.promptRefs[]`
Required. Ordered list of `PromptModule` names whose `content` is concatenated by `order` to form the agent's system prompt. The composed text is written to a ConfigMap and mounted at `/app/config/system.txt`. All prompt text MUST live in PromptModules; inline system prompts are not supported.

See the [PromptModule](#promptmodule) section below for the order-range conventions.

### `spec.triageSummary`
Optional short description (≤200 chars) the coordinator's triage LLM call sees when selecting participants. Distinct from `spec.description` (for humans); this string is in the triage prompt and should be optimized for the LLM's pattern matching.

### `spec.enabledTools[]` / `spec.disabledTools[]`
Optional. Whitelist / blacklist of MCP tool names. Resolved by the agent runtime after MCPGateway tool discovery. If both set, `enabledTools` takes precedence.

Set deliberately small. `qwen3:32b` reliably handles ~10-15 tools; beyond that, tool-call reliability drops sharply. The operator injects the resolved list as `KUBEMOOT_ENABLED_TOOLS` / `KUBEMOOT_DISABLED_TOOLS`.

Scheduling tools (`set_reminder`, `schedule_followup`, `list_scheduled`, `cancel_scheduled`) are provided by the `scheduling-mcp` MCP server, see [Agent Self-Scheduling](../architecture/scheduling.md). Add a dedicated Tooler Agent CR for them rather than enabling on every agent.

### `spec.ragSources[]`
Optional. RAGSource references for knowledge retrieval.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | RAGSource resource name |
| `topK` | int32 | Results to retrieve. Default: 5 - keep low; large RAG payloads degrade tool-calling |
| `priority` | int32 | Higher = retrieved first. Default: 0 |

### `spec.temperature`
String representation of a float (0.0-2.0). Default: `"0.3"` - required for reliable tool selection. The operator writes this to the agent's `application.properties` (Quarkus `BUILD_AND_RUN_TIME_FIXED` constraint; not overridable via env).

### `spec.maxTokens`
Max generation length. Default: 4096. Coordinator typically uses 8192 to fit synthesis output.

### `spec.deployment`
Standard Kubernetes deployment overrides.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `replicas` | int32 | Default: 1 |
| `image` | string | Override agent-runtime image. Defaults to `KubemootConfig.spec.images.agentRuntime` |
| `port` | int32 | HTTP API port. Default: 8080 |
| `resources` | ResourceRequirements | CPU/memory limits |
| `env` | []EnvVar | Additional env vars - useful for `KUBEMOOT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false` on coordinator, longer timeouts, etc. |
| `serviceAccountName` | string | Pod service account |

The operator sets `imagePullSecrets` from `KubemootConfig.spec.defaults.imagePullSecrets` - no per-agent override needed. That field is empty by default (public images need no pull secret); set it on KubemootConfig if you point `global.imageRegistry` at a private mirror.

---

## Status Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `phase` | string | `Pending`, `Deploying`, `Running`, `Error` |
| `ready` | bool | True when the Deployment has at least one ready replica and the scheduler bound a Model |
| `endpoint` | string | Internal service URL (`<name>.<namespace>:8080`) |
| `availableReplicas` | int32 | Running pod count |
| `scheduling.model` | string | Currently bound `Model` CR name |
| `scheduling.provider` | string | Currently bound `ModelProvider` CR name |
| `scheduling.endpoint` | string | Provider endpoint URL |
| `scheduling.lastBoundAt` | timestamp | When the bind decision was last computed |
| `scheduling.lastUnschedulable` | object | Reason + observedAt when no Model matches |
| `ragSourceStatus[]` | RAGSourceRefStatus | RAG readiness per source |
| `conditions[]` | Condition | `Scheduled`, `Available`, `PromptReady`, `ToolsReady` |

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Kubemoot agents collaborate asynchronously via NATS JetStream discussions.

### Agent Topology

A typical deployment uses a coordinator + Tooler (+ optional Analyst) pattern:

```
                    +--------------+
                    |  coordinator |  <- Receives user queries
                    +------+-------+
                           | NATS discussions
            +--------------+--------------+
            |              |              |
    +-------v------+ +----v-----+ +------v-------+
    | k8s-workloads| | k8s-nodes| |  k8s-helm    |  <- Toolers, kubernetes channel
    +--------------+ +----------+ +--------------+
    +--------------+ +--------------+
    |  obs-metrics | |proxmox-nodes |  <- Toolers, observability / proxmox channels
    +--------------+ +--------------+
    +--------------+
    |  k8s-analyst |  <- Analyst, REVIEW phase, kubernetes channel
    +--------------+
```

### Discussion Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Subscribing Agents |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `kubernetes` | K8s workload, node, and Helm queries | k8s-workloads, k8s-nodes, k8s-helm (Toolers); k8s-analyst (Analyst) |
| `observability` | Metrics and monitoring queries | obs-metrics (Tooler) |
| `proxmox` | Hypervisor and VM queries | proxmox-nodes (Tooler) |
| `general` | Catch-all for unclassified queries | All Toolers and Analysts |

Each agent declares its channels via `Agent.spec.discussChannels`. Coordinators typically list every channel the crew uses; Toolers and Analysts list only their domain. See [agentic-consensus.md](../architecture/agentic-consensus.md) for the full discussion protocol.

### Discussion Flow

1. User sends query to coordinator agent
2. Coordinator queries the crew's **resume model** to select the subcommittee, then publishes `thread_start` (with that `innerCircle`) to `kubemoot.discuss.<crew>.<channel>.<threadId>`
3. Only the selected Toolers are woken; the rest are silently excluded (no keyword self-selection)
4. Each selected Tooler runs a per-agent LLM triage (CONTRIBUTE / NOTHING_TO_ADD) for this specific question
5. Contributing Toolers call `directChat()` to generate a contribution (with tool calling); Analysts self-select in the REVIEW phase and reason over the gathered data
6. Agents publish signals (`triaging`, `evaluating`, `agree`, `concern`, `stand_aside`, `failure`, `block`) back to the thread
7. Coordinator settles the discussion based on signals (not a fixed timeout) and synthesizes a response

### Bounded Tool Retries and Failure Signals

The tool-calling loop is bounded along three axes so a misbehaving tool can't hang the discussion forever:

- **Same-tool failure cap** (2): if any individual tool returns an error result twice in the same evaluation, the loop aborts.
- **Total-failure cap** (4): if 4 tool calls across distinct tools all error, the loop aborts - this catches a model spreading its retries across many broken tools rather than one.
- **Iteration cap** (`properties.model().maxToolIterations()`, default 15): if the LLM keeps requesting tools without producing a final answer, the loop aborts.

Any of these aborts publishes a first-class `failure` consensus signal with structured cause metadata (`failureType`, `failedTool`, `lastError`) rather than a generic `stand_aside`. Other failures during mulling (a provider timeout, an out-of-memory error, a messaging hiccup, a runtime error) route through the same failure path with heuristic classification (`model_timeout`, `model_oom`, `provider_unreachable`, `internal_exception`).

A bounded retry policy on the model call itself keeps a slow provider from silently multiplying its own timeout into a multi-minute hang: one retry, then the call surfaces as failed and the failure path takes over. Heartbeats stop the moment an agent publishes any terminal signal, so a finished agent never keeps looking alive after it's done.

The consensus-protocol semantics of `failure` vs `stand_aside` and the three-tier gap classification (`TOOL_GAP` / `INFRASTRUCTURE_GAP` / `SPECIALIST_GAP`) are documented in [agentic-consensus.md](../architecture/agentic-consensus.md#failure-as-a-first-class-signal).

### JIT Provider Selection (Per-Call)

The agent runtime does not use a single, static endpoint frozen into env vars at reconcile time. Each mulling inference call picks the freest provider at the call boundary from live provider state (read from a shared NATS KV bucket), and falls back to the static reconcile-time endpoint only when that live state is unavailable. The picked provider's name flows through to the agent's signal metadata as `metadata.provider`, surfacing in the dashboard's Agent Summary GPU column as the call's real placement. See [scheduler.md](../architecture/scheduler.md#jit-per-call-provider-selection) for the architectural rationale and the `kube-scheduler` analogy.

### Rate Limiting

- Max 1 contribution per thread per agent, plus a sliding-window per-minute cap
- Prevents runaway inference costs from chatty discussion threads
- Configured via `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_MAX_INFERENCES_PER_MINUTE` env var

### Operator-Injected Env Vars

| Env Var | Applies To | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `NATS_URL` | All agents | Operator from NATS service |
| `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_CHANNELS` | All agents | `Agent.spec.discussChannels` (comma-separated) |
| `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_COORDINATOR` | Coordinators | Set `true` when `discussRole=coordinator` |
| `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_TOOLER` | All agents | `false` for coordinators and researcher-role agents |
| `KUBEMOOT_DISCUSS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Coordinator | Optional override via `spec.deployment.env` |

---

## Tool Filtering

Agents connect to MCP tools via the MCPGateway. The number of registered tools significantly affects model behavior - qwen3:32b works reliably with ~10-15 tools but produces empty responses with >20 tools.

### Spec Fields

`Agent.spec.enabledTools[]` is a whitelist; `Agent.spec.disabledTools[]` is a blacklist. The operator injects the resolved set as `KUBEMOOT_ENABLED_TOOLS` / `KUBEMOOT_DISABLED_TOOLS`. If both are set, `enabledTools` takes precedence.

### Tool Categories

| Category | Tools | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Read** | `kubectl_get`, `kubectl_describe`, `kubectl_logs`, `list_api_resources`, `explain_resource` | Cluster inspection |
| **Update** | `kubectl_scale`, `kubectl_patch`, `kubectl_rollout` | Workload management |
| **Helm** | `helm_install`, `helm_upgrade`, `helm_uninstall` | Chart management |

### Guidance

- **Temperature 0.3** (set via `Agent.spec.temperature`) is recommended for reliable tool selection
- Keep total tool count under 15 per agent for reliable behavior
- Specialists should only register tools relevant to their domain (e.g., k8s-helm agent only needs Helm tools + basic read tools)

---

## Agent Design - Cohesion, Coupling, and Question Shape

The mechanics above (tool whitelists, count caps, temperature) are tactical. The strategic question is harder: **how should a crew be decomposed into agents in the first place?** This is the same problem as monolithic-app vs microservices decomposition - and the same heuristics apply. High cohesion within an agent. Loose coupling across agents. The "right" answer is rarely "all in one agent" or "one tool per agent."

### Question shape is the unit of cohesion

A well-designed Tooler answers ONE shape of question:

- "What is X **right now**?" (real-time scalar / instant vector)
- "How did X **trend** over the last hour?" (time series, regressions, spikes)
- "What does X **mean**?" (semantics, units, definitions)
- "Is the **infrastructure** itself healthy?" (meta-observability)
- "**Discover** what's available in domain Y." (introspection)

Each shape pulls a different subset of tools, a different prompt voice ("be concise / show numbers" vs "analyze trend / explain"), and a different per-call latency profile. Mixing shapes inside one agent forces every iteration to carry the union of all tools and all guidance - the LLM pays the cost on every question regardless of which shape it's actually answering.

### When you have a "god agent"

Symptoms:
- 5+ tools spanning several question shapes.
- One-sentence purpose statement is hard to write ("it answers GPU-related questions" - too broad).
- Resume-match scores hover around 0.5-0.7 across many topics - neither clearly relevant nor clearly out-of-scope.
- Latency varies wildly call-to-call because some questions use 1 tool and others use 4 in a loop.
- Per-iteration prompt is large; the model spends tokens choosing among tools that have nothing to do with the current question.

Costs:
- **Slow iterations** - every tool definition is in the prompt, every iteration.
- **Tool-selection accuracy degrades** with too many options (Qwen2.5:32b empirically degrades above ~20 tools - see top of section). qwen3:32b is more forgiving but still benefits from narrowness.
- **Triage ambiguity** - the relevance filter can't cleanly say yes/no.
- **Single failure mode** - when this agent wedges or its model is busy, ALL its question shapes are blocked.
- **Hard to evolve** - adding a tool affects every other capability the agent already covers.

### When you have "atomic" agents

Symptoms:
- 0-1 tools per agent, dozens of agents.
- Many agents triage relevant to the same question; multiple agree on the same answer with the same data.
- Composite questions (need 2+ tools that live in different agents) go unanswered or require multi-agent handoff.
- Triage relevance is precise per agent but the crew listing is large and hard to reason about.
- Each agent adds Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap) and KEDA cold-start latency.

Costs:
- **Orchestration overhead** dominates per-discussion time.
- **Overlapping capabilities** - when two agents have the same answer, the synthesis layer has to choose; if they disagree, the user has to.
- **Capability gaps** - when a question requires N tools spanning N agents, no single agent can answer.
- **Cost of coordination** vs. cost of within-agent inference. Below a threshold, splitting hurts more than it helps.

### The Goldilocks zone

A well-sized Tooler tends to have:

| Dimension | Target |
|---|---|
| Tools | 1-5, all serving the same question shape |
| Description (for triage) | One sentence, clear yes/no for the question types it owns |
| Per-call iterations | Predictable (usually 1-3) because tool selection is unambiguous |
| Relevance score on its own questions | Consistently > 0.85 |
| Relevance score on out-of-scope questions | Consistently < 0.3 |
| Overlap with other agents | Minimal - at most a shared "read" tool family |

### Heuristics for deciding to split

1. **One-sentence test.** If you can't write "I answer X-shaped questions" without using "and" or "or" listing different shapes, split.
2. **Triage ambiguity test.** If the relevance filter returns scores in the 0.4-0.7 band consistently, the agent's scope is too fuzzy.
3. **Tool-shape mapping.** Group the agent's tools by question shape. If a group has only 1-2 tools that nobody else uses, that's a candidate split.
4. **Latency variance.** If the agent's P50 and P90 differ by more than ~3×, different questions are doing very different amounts of work - likely different shapes.
5. **Failure blast radius.** If one tool failing renders the whole agent useless across all question shapes, consider whether the tool deserves its own narrow agent.

### Heuristics for deciding to merge

1. **Always-co-agreeing pair.** If two agents always end up agreeing in the same discussions with substantively identical answers, they have overlapping cohesion - merge them or differentiate their roles.
2. **Sequential dependency.** If question type Z always requires Agent A to answer first and Agent B to follow up, consider a single agent that owns both steps (or a coordinator-level orchestration if it's really common).
3. **Underused capability.** If a tool sits in its own agent but is invoked < 5% of discussions, it's adding triage overhead without earning it - fold it into a related agent.

### Real-world example: nvidia-gpu

Original (god agent, 5 tools, all Prometheus, but four question shapes):

```yaml
name: nvidia-gpu
enabledTools: [execute_query, execute_range_query, list_metrics, get_metric_metadata, get_targets]
```

For "What's GPU utilization on gpu-a?" the agent reasoned through all 5 tool definitions to choose `execute_query`, and a multi-iteration tool loop took ~3 minutes. For "Is the DCGM scrape target up?" it would similarly reason through irrelevant query tools to choose `get_targets`.

Decomposition (three single-shape Toolers):

```yaml
name: nvidia-gpu-now
description: Real-time GPU state queries: current utilization, temperature, VRAM use.
enabledTools: [execute_query]

name: nvidia-gpu-history
description: GPU trend / time-series analysis: how a metric moved over a window.
enabledTools: [execute_range_query, get_metric_metadata]

name: nvidia-gpu-meta
description: Discovery and Prometheus-scrape-health for GPU monitoring.
enabledTools: [list_metrics, get_targets]
```

Each is fast within its shape because its prompt is small and its tool choice is obvious. The coordinator's triage relevance filter picks the right one based on the question; the others stand aside cleanly. The crew gains all the same capabilities, distributed across narrower Toolers.

### Right-sized models are a paired benefit of cohesion

Decomposing a god-agent into single-shape Toolers doesn't only sharpen relevance and shorten tool loops - it also unlocks **right-sized model selection**. A Tooler whose job is one tool call plus a paragraph of formatting doesn't need the same reasoning model as a coordinator synthesizing across multiple agent contributions. When every agent in a crew defaults to a single large model, small-shape Toolers pay for capability they never use, and under per-provider `num_parallel=1` they can starve each other on that one model's slot.

The mechanism is `Agent.spec.capabilities` + `CrewSchedulingPolicy.spec.qualityBias` (see [scheduler.md - Quality bias](../architecture/scheduler.md#quality-bias)). The agent declares an abstract capability (`tool-calling` for a simple Tooler; `+reasoning` for a coordinator or Analyst); the crew author declares what each capability is worth in quality terms; the scheduler resolves to a concrete Model at reconcile time. No agent names a model - loose coupling preserved across cluster boundaries.

A decomposed nvidia-gpu cohort, for example, can have its three single-shape Toolers each declare `[tool-calling, observability]` and resolve to a small fast model, while the coordinator that synthesizes their findings declares `[tool-calling, reasoning]` and resolves to a larger one. One heavy model and many light ones co-exist on the same GPU pool without slot starvation.

### Caveat

These heuristics are guidance, not law. A small single-cluster crew has different optimal granularity than a 100-agent enterprise crew. The right number of agents for *your* crew is the number where the triage layer can confidently route questions to a clear Tooler or Analyst without the per-discussion orchestration cost overwhelming the per-call inference cost.

## MCPGateway Integration

Agents access MCP tools through a centralized MCPGateway rather than connecting to MCPServer pods directly.

### Tool Chain

```
Agent Pod                    MCPGateway Pod               MCPServer Pod
┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────────┐
│ Agent Runtime │──HTTP/──→ │  Gateway     │──HTTP/──→ │ MCP Bridge       │
│              │   SSE      │  (discovers  │   SSE      │ (sidecar)        │
│ LangChain4j   │            │   servers    │            │    │              │
│ tool calling │            │   via labels)│            │    ▼ stdio        │
│              │            │              │            │ MCP Server        │
│              │ ←─tools──  │              │ ←─tools──  │ (kubectl, helm..) │
└──────────────┘  response  └──────────────┘  response  └──────────────────┘
```

### How It Works

1. **MCPGateway** discovers MCPServer pods via label selectors
2. Gateway connects to each server's mcp-bridge sidecar HTTP/SSE endpoint
3. Gateway caches tool definitions from all registered servers
4. Agent connects to gateway via `KUBEMOOT_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT` env var
5. Agent runtime registers available tools with LangChain4j's tool calling framework
6. When the LLM generates a `tool_calls` response, LangChain4j executes the tool via the gateway
7. Gateway routes the tool call to the appropriate MCPServer

### Key Details

- Gateway caches failed connections - if a server is unavailable on first registration, the gateway must be restarted to retry
- Agent gets gateway endpoint via `KUBEMOOT_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT` env var (injected by operator)
- Coordinators set `KUBEMOOT_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false` because they have no MCP tools - only A2A delegation via NATS

---

## System Prompt Composition

System prompts are composed from `PromptModule` CRs referenced by `Agent.spec.promptRefs`. The operator assembles their `content` in `order` and writes the result to a ConfigMap mounted at `/app/config/system.txt`. The agent runtime reads `system.txt` at startup (`KUBEMOOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE` env var).

```yaml
spec:
  promptRefs:
    - discussion-protocol    # order 10
    - response-style         # order 20
    - my-agent-system        # order 30
```

---

## NATS Events

Agents publish and subscribe to NATS subjects for real-time event streaming.

### Chat Events

Each agent publishes to `kubemoot.chat.<agent_name>` on every chat response:

```json
{
  "agentName": "k8s-workloads",
  "conversationId": "abc123",

The dashboard subscribes to `kubemoot.chat.>` for real-time topology node pulsing and the Messages page.

### Discussion Events

Each agent subscribes to `kubemoot.discuss.<crew>.<channel>.>` for inter-agent collaboration (see [agentic-consensus.md](../architecture/agentic-consensus.md)).

### Connection Management

The agent runtime shares one lazy NATS connection across every component in the pod.
If `NATS_URL` is not set, all NATS operations are no-ops - the agent still answers
direct chat requests, it simply doesn't participate in discussions.

## PromptModule

PromptModule is a CRD for reusable prompt fragments composed into agent system prompts via `Agent.spec.promptRefs`. Multiple agents can reference the same module. When a module changes, the operator re-reconciles all agents that reference it.

**Short name:** `pm`

### Spec

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `content` | string | (required) | The prompt text (ADL format recommended) |
| `order` | int32 | 100 | Ordering when composed (lower = earlier in system prompt) |

### Status

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ready` | bool | Module is valid and available |
| `referencedBy` | []string | Agent names using this module |

### Order Conventions

| Order Range | Purpose | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| 1-9 | Coordinator advisory | `advisory-prompt` (5) |
| 10-19 | Shared protocol | `discussion-protocol` (10) |
| 20-29 | Shared style | `response-style` (20) |
| 30-39 | Per-agent identity | `k8s-workloads-system` (30) |
| 40-59 | Coordinator logic | `coordinator-decision-logic` (45), `synthesis-prompt` (50) |

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kubemoot.ai/v1alpha1
kind: PromptModule
metadata:
  name: discussion-protocol
spec:
  order: 10
  content: |
    DEFINE COMPONENT discussion-protocol
    DESCRIPTION Rules for participating in multi-agent discussions

    WHEN the question is NOT in your domain THEN respond NOTHING_TO_ADD immediately
    WHEN the question IS in your domain THEN USE YOUR TOOLS to gather real data
    ALWAYS use tools for verifiable facts
    NEVER give generic instructions without tool-backed evidence
```

## HTTP API

Agents expose an HTTP API at the configured port (`Agent.spec.deployment.port`, default `8080`):

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/chat` | POST | Send message, get response |
| `/chat/stream` | POST | Streaming response (SSE) |
| `/health` | GET | Health check (with dependencies) |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness check (local only) |

### Chat Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://k8s-workloads.crew-homelab-pilot:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What pods are running in the default namespace?"}'
```

### Chat Response

```json
{
  "conversationId": "abc123",
  "message": "Here are the pods running in the default namespace:\n\n| Name | Status | ...",
  "toolCalls": [
    {"name": "kubectl_get", "arguments": {"resource": "pods", "namespace": "default"}}
  ]
}
```
